a subpixel reffers to each of those three parts.

and by turning each of these bars off and on, we can display images smaller than one pixel (awesome i know), essentially tripleing your monitors horizontal resolution!

HI written in 2x4 pixels by turning on and off each subpixel in the pixels.  
Here the top left pixel (the top of the H), has the RGB value (255, 0, 255), turning the red bar completely on, the green bar off, and the blue bar completely on in order to display the two lines on either side of the H.  
we can also shrink this to approx a third of its origional height to make it more readable
